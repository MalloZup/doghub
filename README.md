# doghub

It monitor stale Issues and PR on GitHub for your different projects in a private and centralized manner.

# Rationale:

- 1) allow maintainers  to be indipendent, don't allow some X service in their repo. (instead use token and manage yourself the daemon on your server)

- 2) offer a full centralized control for list of repo you want to monitor.


# Quickstart

1) create  `doghub.edn` file

```
{

  :github-config {
     :token "my-token"
  }

    ;; a list of repository of github where you want to monitor issue and prs
  :repositories ["MalloZup/missile", "MalloZup/doghub"]

  :issue-days 130 ;; this is the number of day you will tollerate for an issue to be inactive

  :prs-days 2 ;; tollerations days for Pull-request. PR older then this will be take action.


 ;; by default doghub will create a comment on the issue or PR. you can customize the prefix message.


 :prefix-msg "autogenerated with https://github.com/MalloZup/doghub: "


 ;; the message compose of prefix-msg + std-msg.  std-msg will be " the pr/issue is old then 10/X days. 
  
 ;; the bot will just update the comments.  RATE-LIMITING will be logged in case of exceeded


}

```

Instead of a list of repositories you can use a list of organisations.

2) start the daemon with:

```java -jar doghub-VERSION-standalone.jar```

The configuration file should be on the same dir where you start the daemon; 
otherwise use the ENV variable `CONFIG_FILE_PATH` for setup a config file from other locations
