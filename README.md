# doghub

Doghub is a Stalebot.
It monitor stale Issues and PR on GitHub for your different projects in a private and centralized manner.

# Rationale:

Other stalebot exists, but they are mainly run as service that you need to authorize on your  different GitHub repos.

Doghub has 2 goals in mind:

- 1) allow maintainers  to be indipendent, don't allow some X service in their repo. (instead use token and manage yourself the daemon on your server)

- 2) offer a full centralized control for list of repo you want to monitor.


Also it is data-driven, functional and concurrent by design.

# Quickstart

1) create  `doghub.edn` file

```
{

 :github-config {
     :token "my-token"
  }

 ;; a list of repository of github where you want to monitor issue and prs
 :repositories ["MalloZup/missile", "MalloZup/saint-build"]

 ;; this is the number of days you will tollerate for an issue to be inactive (write comments on issues older then 10 days)
 :issue-days 10

 ;; by default doghub will create a comment on the issue or PR. you can customize the prefix message.
 :prefix-msg "[autogenerated with https://github.com/MalloZup/doghub]"

 ;; example:
 ;; prefix-msg + std-msg
 ;;              std-msg == "issue older then " issue-days "days. Please update the issue or close it" 

```

2) start the daemon with:

```java -jar doghub-VERSION-standalone.jar```

The configuration file should be on the same dir where you start the daemon; 
otherwise use the ENV variable `CONFIG_FILE_PATH` for setup a config file from other locations
